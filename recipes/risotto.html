    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter and oil: </strong>This recipe starts with butter and olive oil melted in the bowl of an Instant Pot.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>You’ll need three cups of diced mushrooms and a cup of chopped onion.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>The mushroom risotto is seasoned with fresh rosemary, salt, and pepper.  </li>
            <li><strong>Rice: </strong>Arborio rice is high in starch, so it’s perfect for making risotto. </li>
            <li><strong>White wine: </strong>Choose a crisp, dry white wine like pinot grigio. </li>
            <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade chicken or vegetable stock. </li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan: </strong>Parmesan cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this rich and creamy risotto recipe. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Add butter and olive oil; stir until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add rosemary sprig; cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir rice into the pot until each grain is coated with butter and olive oil mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in stock, stirring to scrape the sides of the pot. Simmer for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Turn the venting knob to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. It will take time for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Tap venting knob a few times with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stand back; turn knob to point at vent. Remove lid when pressure is released, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir risotto until creamy, about 1 minute. Discard rosemary sprig. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
